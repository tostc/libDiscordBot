### Prerequisites
First you need following software and libraries.

* CMake
* C++ compiler which supports C++14
    * Compiles with clang and gcc under Linux.
    * Compiles with Visual Studio 2019 under Windows.
* Maybe runs flawless on the Raspberry Pi (not Tested)
    * For more informations please visit [this](https://github.com/tostc/libDiscordBot/issues/9#issue-715171899) issue, and look under `Compiling the bot with the lib:`

## Getting Started
These instructions will help you compile and use the library to build your own bot.

1. Cloning the repository:

```
git clone --recurse-submodules -j8 --single-branch https://github.com/tostc/libDiscordBot.git
```
side note: if you want to clone a specfic branch, you can include `-b *name of the branch you want to clone*` anywhere in the command (obviously, only after `git clone`).

2. Building the project:

```
cd libDiscordBot/
mkdir build
cd build/
cmake ../
```

For Linux execute following command inside the build directory
```
make
```

For Windows open the *.sln file inside the build directory

3. Copy and rename the project_template directory somewhere to get starting. Follow the introduction inside the README.MD of the template.

## Crosscompiling

To crosscompile the library there are toolchain files inside the crosscompile folder.
How to use

1. Do the same steps (1 - 2) as describe above except the `cmake ../` step.
2. The current way to set the root of your compiler toolchain is currently sadly to insert the path inside the `crosscompile/TOOLCHAINFILE.cmake` file as ROOT_PATH.
4. Call cmake with the following parameters.
```
cmake ../ -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../crosscompile/TOOLCHAINFILE.cmake
```
5. You can now compile your programm.
